# CharterSDao

# Charter School Dao ran by Soulbound tokens.~

What’s the problem? About 9-18 school board members are voting on the fate of our educational systems.

Solution: Let’s have public school institutional funds controlled by a community Dao. Let’s decentralize the public schools in underserved communities.

Charter Success is a Dao controlled by Soulbound tokens.
Delegates have to attend parent teacher conferences and earn a kind of accreditation or certification for being competent in the field of education and live within the zip code.
